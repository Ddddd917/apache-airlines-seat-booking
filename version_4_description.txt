Version 4: Full OOP Refactoring and Controller Replacement
This update completes Version 4 of the Apache Airlines Seat Booking System.

✅ Key features added:

- Replaced `main.py` with `booking_system.py` as the new central controller  
- Refactored all core modules into dedicated classes using object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- Added `BookingManager`, `SeatMap`, `Validator`, `DatabaseManager`, and `SearchManager` classes  
- Improved code structure, clarity, and modularity for long-term scalability  
- Integrated full passport number validation (6–9 alphanumeric characters)  
- Applied static validation methods and consistent error handling  
- Separated seat operations and user logic for better maintainability  
- Updated seat status logic to eliminate legacy `row/col` structure  
- Preserved all Version 3 functionalities within the new OOP structure  

This version satisfies the structural and maintainability requirements of Part C in the FC723 coursework project.
